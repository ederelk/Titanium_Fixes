To update an existing iOS module and make it 64-bit compatible follow these steps:

    - Open the module's Xcode project. (  dot xcodeproj file.  ) 
    - You should have at least one warning asking you to update the project to the "recommended settings", do that.
    - Change all architectures to $(ARCHS_STANDARD) or (arm6,arm7).
    - Set the deployment target to at least iOS 6.0 or the latest ios version.
    - Compile. (if you get an error while compiling it would usually be related tothe sdk version specified in the titanium.xcconfig
      file. make sure you change it to 3.5.0.GA or whatever version you are using currently)
    - open your command line interface and change diretory (cd /PATH/TO/MODULE/) to your module folder. (make sure you delete the zip file and the build folder from the module's folder)
    - run this command : python build.py
    - you module is now built. 
    - xcrun lipo -info build/lib.<MODULE_NAME>.a
      the output should be:
        Architectures in the fat file: build/lib.your_module_here.a are: armv7 i386 x86_64 arm64. (If it is not then you missed something)
