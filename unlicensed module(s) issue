Appcelerator Titanium Module - Verification issue, unlicensed module(s)

You need to follow steps as follows:

- Open Terminal and run “uuidgen”
- Copy the code you see on the terminal
- Open tiapp.xml, replace what’s in the “guid” tag with the the code you copied.
- In Titanium Studio, do Project –> Clean
- Run

Concept is to change GUID of module which is mentioned in manifest.
